<h3 class="h3-heading">About</h3>
<p>This is the third milestone project of the fullstack software development course of Code Institute. It is the first
    'full stack' project combining a database, a backend and a frontend. The aim is to demonstrate a full understanding
    of Python, MongoDB and Flask. </p>

<p>The project revolves around the mastery of the CRUD concept: <span class="bold">C</span>reate, <span
        class="bold">R</span>ead, <span class="bold">U</span>pdate and <span class="bold">D</span>elete. Being able to
    use this concept, opens a whole new world of possibilities to create web apps.</p>
