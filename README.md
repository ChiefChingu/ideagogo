## Introduction
This is the third milestone project of the fullstack software development course of Code Institute. I choose to create a 'light' Indiegogo clone: users can upload ideas. Other users can 'back' the idea by casting a vote on the project. The most popular project will be highlighted at the top of the page.

The project uses the required base functionality of CRUD: users can create, read, update and delete their projects. As a bonus a voting system is implemented, which requires user authentication.

To keep the project within a manageable scope you can only upload projects within the energy and green tech section. The live project can be found here: [https://ideagogo.herokuapp.com](https://ideagogo.herokuapp.com).

## UX
All designs start from the mobile perspective. Larger viewports are handled with media queries.

### Strategy Plane
#### Product objectives
As a site owner my objective is: show my skills and qualifications in order to pass the third milestone project.
I added one more objective to this: I want to get a score of at least 80% in order to receive 'first grade honors' at the end of the complete course.

#### User needs
There are two types of users in addition to the site owner role. A user who has an idea and a user who is curious and wants to view other persons' ideas. 
- A user who has an idea can post this idea. This user type is the idea owner. 
- A user who wants to see ideas can view all ideas that are posted. This user type is the idea viewer.
- An idea owner is an idea viewer by default (they always view their own idea).
- An idea viewer can become an idea owner when he or she posts an idea.

##### User needs idea owner
- Easy and intuitive way to post an idea.
- Make the idea 'findable': add categorization and/or labels.
- Let the world know about the idea: social sharing options.

##### User needs idea viewer
- Easy and intuitive way to browse ideas.
- Pick favorites: vote on ideas that are interesting.

##### User needs site owner
- Authority to edit and delete all ideas of all users.
- Manage (CRUD) categories and tags.

### Scope Plane
When designing this project a lot of ideas came up. Keeping the main objective in mind (pass the third milestone project) I decided to have these basic features (Full details on features: [Features](#features).)

#### Basic Features
- idea cards: quickly glance over an idea. Click to show more details on the card.
- CRUD on ideas: create, read, update and delete for site owner and idea owner.
- categorization: add a category to which your idea belongs.
- specification: add 3 tags to specify what your idea is about.

#### Advanced Features
Advanced features for a high grade are:
- vote on ideas.
- account creation.
- idea authorisation: only idea owners and site owner can perform edit and delete actions.
- limit the votes: a user cannot vote multiple times on the same project.
- make all labels clickable and initiate a search query.
- store images in MongoDB.
- manage ideas, categories and tags via a custom made backend.

### Structure Plane
The structure of the site is straightforward: a homepage connects to the idea overview page, an about page, a contact page, a registration page and a login page.

The idea overview page connects to all idea detail pages. From each idea detail page you can access the edit idea page (if you are the idea owner). Only visible to the site owner: an admin page where the categories and tags are managed (CRUD).

There is one special page: the account required page. This page is triggered when a user wants to perform an action while not logged in (vote, add idea).

### Skeleton Plane
This project is designed with the mobile user in mind: mobile first and desktop second. The mobile viewport is the baseline. Media queries are used to handle the larger  viewports.

The wireframes are found [here](https://github.com/ChiefChingu/ideagogo/blob/master/Ideagogo%20-%20wireframes.pdf).

### Surface Plane
The final product can be viewed [here](https://ideagogo.herokuapp.com).

#### Typography
For this project the Google font Roboto is used. Roboto is an open source, sans-serif font originally developed by Google for Android. Its a modern, crisp typeface which fits perfectly in this project.

#### Color palette
The background color is white: easy on the eye, provides a clean and clear background. This makes it possible to add accents with these contrasting colors:

- Blue for background of hero and mobile menu (#e0f0fa).
- Pink for contrast (#e84d74).

The contrasting colors are checked in a [color blind web page filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter) with good results on all filters.

### User Stories
There are three different roles (site owner, idea owner and idea viewer). For each role the user stories are as follows:

#### As a site owner I want to be able to
1. Deal with upload of unwanted content.
2. Manage the idea category names.
3. Manage the idea tag names.

#### As an idea owner I want to be able to
4. Post my idea.
5. Upload a picture.
6. Change my uploaded picture.
7. Review my post.
8. Edit my post.
9. Delete my post.
10. Invite my friends to view and vote for my idea.

#### As an idea viewer (and idea owner) I want to be able to

11. Find interesting ideas.
12. Vote on ideas that interest me.
13. See that my vote was successful.
14. Remove my vote.
15. See that my vote was removed succesfully.
16. Share ideas to friends.
17. Send a message to the site owner.
18. View information about the site.

## Data structure
The project brief was very explicit about the use of MongoDB, a non SQL database. This does not mean though that one should not think about the database structure carefully.

### Database Overview
The data was initially organised in seven collections. Two were automatically generated by using file upload in MongoDB (fs.chunks and fs.files). One was eventually dropped (Votes), but kept in here to show the thinking process while designing a voting system.

The collections are visually displayed as follows: ![](https://github.com/ChiefChingu/ideagogo/blob/master/ideagogodb.jpg?raw=true).

For each collection the fields are displayed below. The default id field is omitted in this overview. 

#### Users
- username: linked with ideas collection (field: username).
- email
- password: hashed password.
- voted_ideas: array of idea ids (To keep track of ideas in future account page and for alternative mechanism to enforce one vote per user on same project).

#### Ideas
- idea_title
- idea_summary
- idea_details
- category_name: linked with categories collection (field: category_name).
- idea_tag1: linked with tags collection (field: tag_name).
- idea_tag2: linked with tags collection (field: tag_name).
- idea_tag3: linked with tags collection (field: tag_name).
- image_name: linked with fs.files collection (field: filename).
- total_votes
- views
- user_votes: array of usernames that have voted on this particular project.
- date_added
- username: linked with users collection (field: username).

#### Categories
- category_name: linked with ideas collection (field: category_name).

#### Tags
- tag_name: linked with tags collection (fields: idea_tag1, idea_tag2, idea_tag3).

#### fs.chunks
Auto generated. Contains the data for all files that reside in fs.files.

#### fs.files
- filename: linked with ideas collection (field: image_name).
- contentType
- md5
- chunkSize
- length
- uploadDate

#### Votes
Removed. Initially created to design the logic for a one vote per user per project. For this I embarked on the thought train of setting the vote ID to the idea title and add user names that have voted in an array. If a user wants to vote, this collection is checked first to see if that user already exists. If so, no vote is possible.

In the end this proved to be too complex at the front end: using jinja if statements I wanted to display or hide the vote button, but ran into too many problems. See commit [04b75f1e290593f460efd8893e12c2a2f8cb5ca2](https://github.com/ChiefChingu/ideagogo/commit/04b75f1e290593f460efd8893e12c2a2f8cb5ca2) and following commits.

## Testing
All standard online tests passed without any major problems.

The online and manual tests are detailed in the [TEST.md](https://github.com/ChiefChingu/ideagogo/blob/master/TEST.md).

## Deployment
Assumption: VSC and Python are installed locally. If not, please refer to these installation guides:
- [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

### Deploy locally
#### Database Setup
- Create a database on [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
- Create collections as specified under [Data structure](#data-structure).
- Add some tags and categories to be able to add ideas later on via the front end.

#### Clone GitHub repo
- Start VSC and open the folder where you want to clone the project to.
- Open the terminal (ctrl + `) and type ```git clone https://github.com/ChiefChingu/ideagogo.git```.
- Navigate to the folder ideagogo and rename if preferred.

#### Create and activate virtual environment
Create a virtual environment to make sure dependencies only apply to this project.

- Type ```python -m venv env```.
- Open the command palette (ctrl + shift + p).
- Type 'Python select interpreter' and select.
- Select your Python version in the dropdown (in my case 'Python 3.7.7 64-bit ('env':venv)').
- Then activate your virtual environment (ctrl + shift + `).
- You'll see ```(env)``` before the directory name in your terminal.

#### Install Flask and packages
- Type ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```. This will install all necessary programs and packages.

#### Set valid connection Pymongo
- The authentication is omitted from the app.py on purpose. Leaving credentials in a publicly visible file is bad practice.
- To specify the correct credentals:
    - Create a file named env.py
    - Make sure this file is registered in your .gitignore.
    - Copy the following into the env.py file and replace <password> with your own password (make sure to remove the <>).

```
import os

os.environ[
    "bashrc"
] = "mongodb+srv://root:<password>@cluster0-36t8l.mongodb.net/ideas?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "ohsosecret"
```

#### Add a dummy idea
The web app cannot run without an entry for ideas. You can add an idea via the admin of Mongodb.

#### Run the web app
With all things set:

- Make sure you are in the activated virtual environment.
- Type ```$env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"``` and ```flask run``` to run the app in normal mode.
- Type ```$env:FLASK_DEBUG=1``` and ```flask run```  to run the app in debug mode.
